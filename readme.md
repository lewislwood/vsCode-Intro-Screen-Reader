In this YouTube playlist, I describe how to interact with the VisualStudio Code editor using a screen reader. 

## Why This Project

Transitioning can be quite overwhelming and daunting for those who had had their world turned upside down by blindness. Young coders can benefit by learning how a code editor such as VSCode works. If you are a blind coder, you can do this.

People who are blind consume code line by line. Our sighted counterparts can take in a whole screen at a glance. Most VSCode instructions refer to using the mouse for selecting, cutting, pasting, moving, and copying text, and all other actions. People who are blind must rely on the keyboard to perform actions in VSCode and elsewhere. Many of the usual hints and messages sitting off to the side go unnoticed for a very long time, if at all. So any help in jumping in and understanding why you would want to use certain capabilities can be overwhelming.

In this video series, I provide the most critical elements for code editing, navigation, selection, cutting, copying, and pasting using only the keyboard. I give you a workflow and approach for entering code and creating the least amount of errors to fix. I fill in where documentation and other tutorials are lacking for people who are blind and visually impaired.

This YouTube playlist consists of 10 video parts and 14 videos. I strived to make the videos shorrt: 15 minutes or less. A few are 20+ minutes long. The sound of the screen reader is in one ear while the narration is in the other ear. This means you can adjust the volume of each ear separately. I use Fusion with Jaws in this video, but all content is valid for any other screen reader including NVDA.
