This catalog of audio webinars introduce Vs Code to visually impaired. Techniques for navigating and modifying code.  Also how to change sttings.

Microsfot Accessiblity provide some wonderful webinars/videos as well. This is a supplement. I express techniques that have helped me along using a screen reader.  It is so hard, since sighted take for granted that the knowledge to perform that task is quite obvious (Just look!).  
 
I hope to address these issues and present a large catalog of videos in a quick manner.
