Explain how to perform split editing. This is where a file is editing in 2 windows/groups. Explain editor groups and perform a snippet, then block copy a folded code from one group to the newly created snippet code.
Lastly I demonstrate anchor selection, where you drop an anchor selection. Move somewhere else in the code and select to the cursor from the anchor point.
ctrl + backslash to split. ctrl + k ctrl + l to fold as well.
ctrl+k ctrl+b drop anchor, ctrl+k+ctrl+k to select from anchor to cursor.
