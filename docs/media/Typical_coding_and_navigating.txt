A typical session of coding using vsCode. Here I outline how I utilize the various techniques for shortcuts, navigation, and picklists to do my job. All this done using a screen reader.
I walk through a recent mod. I use multiple editing groups, multiple points in a single file. Use a basic search and an object/symbol search. Checking for errors. The typescript app is displaying a dialog modal and giving out screen reader help messages.
