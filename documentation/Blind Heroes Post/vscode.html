<p>This YouTube playlist I describe how we blind interact with Visual Studio Code editor using a screen reader.  Transitioning can be quite overwhelming and daunting for those whom had to world turned upside down by blindness.              Also young coders can benefit by learning how a code editor such as vsCode works.</p>

<p>We blind consume our code one line at a time, unlike our sighted counterparts yse a graphical mouse and strategic right clicks for context menus for selection, text movinp, and pasting. Many of the usual hints and messageses sitting off to side go unnoticed for a very long time by blind coders. So any help in jumping in and understanding why they would want to use certain capabilities can be overwhelming.
   My hope is that I provide the most critical elements for code editing, navigation, selecting, cutting, and pasting.  Also telling you what some of those features are. I give you a workflow on approaches for entering code and creating the least amount of errors to fix.  I hope I fill in where documentation and other tutorials are lacking for visually impaired.</p>

<p>This YouTube playlist currently consists of 10 video parts and 14 videos.  I strived to make the videos shorrt 15 minutes.  Unfortunately a few of them are 20+ minutes long.  I also placed my screen reader in one ear and my narration in the other ear.  This means you can adjust the volumes of each of them. I am using Fusion with Jaws in this video, but all is valid for any other screen reader including NVDA.</p>

<h2><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8M4jaHx-cNhsqVpBztPNqgf2OHQZ57AJ">vsCode Introduction using a screen reader</a></h2>

<p>While watching the videos on YouTube you will want to turn off screen navigation keys, in order to use YouTube's short cut keys.
j or l will rewind 10 seconds or fast foward
k to pause or play
shift &lt; or > to increase or decrese playback rate
comma or . when paused will advance or back a frame ( useful) for ocr and visually impaired
shift+N or P for next or previouse video in the playlist
shift+? help screen ( you will need navigation keys for this dialogue)</p>
