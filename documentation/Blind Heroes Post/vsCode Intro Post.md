In this YouTube playlist I describe how we blind interact with Visual Studio Code editor using a screen reader. Transitioning can be quite overwhelming and daunting for those whom, the world has turned upside down by blindness. Young coders can also benefit by learning how a code editor such as vsCode works.

Unlike our sighted counterparts who use a graphical mouse and strategic right clicks to access context menus for selection, text moving, and pasting, we blind consume our code one line at a time. Many of the usual hints and messages sitting off to side go unnoticed for a very long time by blind coders. So, any help in jumping in and understanding why they would want to use certain capabilities can be overwhelming. My hope is that I provide the critical elements essential for code editing, navigation, selecting, cutting, and pasting.  Also to make you aware on what some of those features are. I will give you a workflow and approaches to code while making the least amount of errors possible.  I hope to fill in where documentation and other tutorials are lacking for visually impaired.
   
This YouTube playlist currently consists of 10 parts in a total of 14 videos.  I have strived to make the videos as short as 15 minutes.  Unfortunately, a few of them are 20+ minutes long. I have made it so that in one year you can hear my screen reader in one ear and my narration in the other. Making it easy for you to adjust the volumes of each of them based on your requirement.
I am using Fusion with Jaws in this video, but all of this is valid for any other screen reader including NVDA.
