Part 4 Split Editor Groups  Anchor Selection
17:29

Explains how to perform split editing. This is where a file is edited in 2 windows/groups. Explains editor groups and performing a snippet, then block copy a folded code from one group to the newly created snippet code.
Lastly I demonstrate anchor selection, where you place an anchor, Move somewhere else in the code, and select to the cursor from the anchor point.
ctrl + backslash to split. ctrl + k ctrl + l to fold.
ctrl+k ctrl+b to drop anchor, ctrl+k+ctrl+k to select from anchor to cursor.
