vsCode Pt 4 Split Editor Groups  Anchor Selection
Explain how to perform split editing. This is where a file is editing in 2 windows/groups. Explain editor groups and perform a snippet, then block copy a folded code from one group to the newly created snippet code.
Lastly I demonstrate anchor selection, where you drop an anchor selection. Move somewhere else in the code and select to the cursor from the anchor point.
ctrl + backslash to split. ctrl + k ctrl + l to fold as well.
ctrl+k ctrl+b drop anchor, ctrl+k+ctrl+k to select from anchor to cursor.

We as blind coders proccess coding one line at a time and fail to see those helpful hints decorating the screens that our sighted counterparts see.
This is part of a series of videos on using vsCode with a screen Reader, such a Jaws and NVDA.  This serious will outline on the tips and tricks I as a blind code have figured out for myself. This will supplement other resources, that are for all coders (blind or sighted).
