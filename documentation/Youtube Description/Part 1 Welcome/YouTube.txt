vsCode Pt 1 Welcome

Introduce vsCode interface briefly.  Discuss some of my screen reader customizations. How to explore debug console/terminal terminal tree. Discuss some keys.

We as blind coders process coding one line at a time and fail to see those helpful hints decorating the screens that our sighted counterparts see.
This is part of a series of videos on using vsCode with a screen Reader, such a Jaws and NVDA.  This series will outline the tips and tricks I as a blind coder have figured out for myself. This will supplement other resources, that are for all coders (blind or sighted).
