Each folder below is a youbutube video in this series

You will see 2 text files.
One is relevant to the video only.
The other is Youtube.txt  this one I simply had a generic imported the specifics for the current video and copied relevant links as well.

YouTube has a search algorithyme that it uses to return your video in a search. My channel has the following tags (Jaws, NVDA, Blind, screen reader)
Now the sooner you mention something the higher the priority for that word.  

Thank You ahead of time.
